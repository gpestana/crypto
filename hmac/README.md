Implements HMAC-SHA\* in rust (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

In cryptography, an hash message authentication code (HMAC) is short tag that
is generated by an hash function and a secret. The HMAC can be used to prove
data integrity and (symmetric) authentication of the message. HMAC does not
encrypt the message. The message must be sent alongside with the HMAC so that
the recipient can verify its integrity and authenticity.

## Specs

```
HMAC(K, m) = H((K' ^ opad) || H(K' ^ ipad) || m)

where,
- K'= H(K) [if len(K) > block_size] OR K [otherwise]
- opad - outer padding, consisting of repeated bytes 0x5c until block_size 
- ipad - inner padding, consisting of repeated bytes 0x36 until block_size
```

The blocksize of this implementation is 64 bits since the key may not be
generated with
[full entropy](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/34864/key-size-for-hmac-sha256#34866)
